<p>Hi, here I will publish some little pieces of work while switching from PHP to C#.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>
   <a href="https://github.com/redflitzi/StrTr">StrTr for C#</a><br>
   This is a String Extension for having the PHP strtr function, which is mising in C# but was very handy in PHP.
 </p>
 <p>It supports the "two strings" approach for chars to replace as well as the "array" thing.<br>
  Instead of the associative array, a List of tuples or a Dictionary of Key=>Value pairs can be used.
