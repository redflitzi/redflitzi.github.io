<p>Hi, here I will from time to time publish some little pieces of work while switching from PHP to C#.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>
   <a href="https://github.com/redflitzi/StrTr">PHP's StrTr for C#</a><br>
  This is a String Extension for having the PHP <b>strtr</b> function, which is missing in C# but was very handy in PHP.<br>
  It comes as a <b>String.StrTr</b> method with several overloads.
 </p>
 <p>It supports the "two strings" approach for chars to replace as well as the "array" thing.<br>
  Instead of the associative array, a List of Tuples or a Dictionary of Key=>Value pairs can be used as first argument.<br>
  There is also the option of providing the ("original", "replacement") Tuples directly as method arguments.
 </p>
 <p>As you may see,I enjoy very much having this functionality of <b>strtr</b> back in C#!</p>
